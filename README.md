# Churn & Burn
Churn & Burn is a simple tool for travelhackers who primarily use credit card churning as a way of accruing travel points. The webapp allows users to add credit cards upon application approval, tracking active cards during promotional spending periods to calculate how much they have to spend by what deadline in order to secure sign-up bonuses. Users can choose cards from a list of currently available products to add to their accounts, view current cards, and update their user profiles. 



## Tech Stack
**Back end:** Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Faker
**Front end:** React, JavaScript, Fetch, Bootstrap, HTML 5, CSS 3


## Features
Churn & Burn has a very simple, intuitive interface. On the landing page, users can register for an account, and log in to access their dashboard.

The app is a one-page app, with three pageviews rendered in one place on the Dashboard. Users can navigate using the page cards, or from the Navbar above.


**My Cards** shows the currently active cards linked to a users account. A spending calculator allows them to input their current spending, and the calculator compares this against the credit cardâ€™s requirements, returning how much they need to spend by what date in order to unlock their sign-up bonus.

**Add a New Card** lets users select a credit card from currently offered products to add to their account. Churn & Burn's database updates credit card offerings with their current bank's promotional restrictions.
